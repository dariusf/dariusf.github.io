Effectful higher-order functions Specifying higher-order functions today Example 1: mutating the list Example 2: stronger precondition Example 3: effects outside metalogic Staged logic Effectful placeholders Recursion Re-summarization Compaction via biabduction Solutions to the problematic examples Example 1 Example 2 Example 3 Conclusion Effectful higher-order functions Programs written in mainstream languages today are rife with effectful higher-order functions: functions which take other functions as arguments, where these arguments may use primitive side effects, such as state, exceptions, or algebraic effects.</description></item><item><title>Satisfying Music Theory</title><link>https://dariusf.github.io/drafts/satisfying-music-theory/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Dec 2022 10:41:06 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://dariusf.github.io/drafts/satisfying-music-theory/</guid><description>This post is about my experiments in generating music using SMT.
As a teaser, here is a procedurally-generated harmonization of the first line of Joy to the World. Given the melody (in the soprano voice), the system produces the other three voices in a way that makes harmonic sense.

Bird analogies, gestures, calls, and songs are common in warmups, and in both activities, you are trying to steer a small flapping thing along a fine line through (your) pipes, backed by a lush (musical) landscape.
To make that less of a reach, I cobbled together a prototype of a singing-powered Flappy Bird, based on an open source clone of the game.</description></item></channel></rss>
