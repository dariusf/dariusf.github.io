Darius is a third-year Computer Science undergraduate at the National University of Singapore (NUS).

He was an intern at the [SUTD Game Innovation Programme](http://gamelab.sutd.edu.sg/gip/) and is currently working part-time as a teaching assistant for [a freshman course in functional programming](http://jedi.ddns.comp.nus.edu.sg/).

He relishes the experience of programming and its medium, programming languages, and can usually be found writing compilers for [obscure languages](http://blog.codecombat.com/new-experimental-languages-python-lua-clojure-and-io) and small DSLs. He also enjoys designing hipster games and writing fiction in his spare time.

He thought that this exposition would be less awkward if written in the third person.
