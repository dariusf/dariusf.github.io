A web app for creating colourful mind maps. That could extend indefinitely across a 2D canvas. That could also extend indefinitely *into* the canvas -- being fans of recursion we thought it'd be cool if each node in the mind map had room for *another* mind map.

Dendryte was created as part of the [Orbital programme](http://orbital.comp.nus.edu.sg/) at NUS. It was built with RaphaelJS and Google App Engine, and is [completely open source](https://github.com/dariusf/dendryte).
