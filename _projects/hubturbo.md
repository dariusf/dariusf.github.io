An issue tracker built for GitHub, providing conveniences for project management and a more advanced developer workflow. Among its features are a DSL for filtering issues, issue and label hierarchies, and a dynamic drag-and-drop-based interface.

It is currently being used by students of CS2103 Software Engineering, as well as in [internal projects](https://github.com/PowerPointLabs/) at the NUS School of Computing.

HubTurbo was built with JavaFX 8 and is [completely open source](https://github.com/HubTurbo/HubTurbo).
