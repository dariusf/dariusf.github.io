A text editor I originally created because I was dissatisfied with managing slews of documents for my writing. Other writing software felt rigid and constraining; I needed a more flexible way of organising everything, a way that could change with my needs. Naturally I settled on a tree of nodes, each of which could contain text as well as other nodes.

Synthesis is special to me because it was my first major software project. I redesigned it several times over a period of five years or so, as I learned programming: there was a web version, and at least two more written in Visual Basic. This particular incarnation was how I taught myself Java.
