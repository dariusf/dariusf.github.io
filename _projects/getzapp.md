A puzzle platformer created during the [SUTD Game Innovation Programme](http://gamelab.sutd.edu.sg/gip).

I worked with the game's original creative team to polish it for commercial release.

Screenshots and a gameplay trailer are available [here](http://gamelab.sutd.edu.sg/training/project/getzapp/).
