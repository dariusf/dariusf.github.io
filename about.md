I'm all about finding principled ways to solve problems (with computers) and making people around me more productive. To that end, I'm interested in functional programming, formal systems, program analysis, and declarative paradigms such as logic programming and ASP. I believe powerful tools are essential if we wish to tackle more complex problems.

I am an occasional game developer and also enjoy building and working with interactive systems.

On weekends, I sing with [The Crescendos](https://www.instagram.com/the_crescendos/) and [Acappella Anonymous](https://www.instagram.com/acappellaanonymous/).

I've participated in [NaNoWriMo](https://www.nanowrimo.org/) several times but have never won. My most stubborn attempt saw me continue writing for the next 13 months, producing 110K words of rambling prose which I never looked at again.
