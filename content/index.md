I'm a PhD student in the [PLSE lab](https://nus-plse.github.io/) at NUS.

My research focuses on new ways to specify and verify [higher-order](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hipsleek/Heifer/StagedSL/docs/FM2024_TR.pdf), [effectful](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~yahuis/ICFP24/ICFP2024.pdf) [programs](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~yahuis/APLAS2022.pdf). I previously also worked on [specification and testing techniques for distributed systems](https://dariusf.github.io/cpluscal.pdf).

I am more generally interested in all aspects of programming languages and formal verification. My goal is to build better tools for developers and lower the barrier to engineering reliable software.

Augment creativity
Most of my work has explored this through the lens of programming languages and logic, languages to describe interesting phenomena and mechanise reasoning about it.

Create art using computers
I am also interested in exploring how computers can support and enhance creative work. Producing programs, music, art, narratives. Both for casual creators and experts.

Creative endeavour. New tools

Satisfying music theory
3d buildings, trees with holes, spaceships and shape grammars
Asp narrative generation

Programming as a means of creative expression. Some of my work in this direction:

The use of logic to model and support creative practice

Interested in how computers can support creative work

My PhD is on verification, the use logic and computers to help in the construction of software
