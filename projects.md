Most of what I've built is on [GitHub](https://github.com/dariusf), but here are a few more closed-source/proprietary things.

- [Shrink Simulator](https://globalgamejam.org/2015/games/shrink-simulator-2015), Global Game Jam 2015
- [Logophile](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.github.dariusf.logophile), a small game about words
- [Vigilante](http://globalgamejam.org/2014/games/vigilante), an artsy game for Global Game Jam 2014
- [Getzapp](http://gamelab.sutd.edu.sg/training/project/getzapp/), a puzzle platformer
- [Tower of Myr: Crystal Stream](http://gamelab.sutd.edu.sg/training/project/tom-crystalstream/), a turn-based strategy game
